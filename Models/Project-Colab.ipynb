    "This is the accompanying notebook to the Medium Blog entitled [\"'Don't forget the milk again!': Predicting temporal shopping sets using Graph Neural Networks\"](https://medium.com/@wwwidonja/dont-forget-the-milk-again-adc8924fdbe1). It was prepared as part of the Stanford CS224W course project @UL FRI; 2021/22 by Sara Bizjak, Maruša Oražem and Vid Stropnik. While this notebook is meant to be self-sufficient, it will be best experienced by concurrently reading the accompanying blog, linked above. Here, a more robust and theorethical overview of the model and problem at hand will be given, while the blog contextualizes the intent of the model more thoroughly and also gives a good introduction into the theory used here."

    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll be implementing a model for temporal set prediction. Namely, we'll be working on the example of predicting future shopping carts by observing the purchasing habit of a given household in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a model proposed by [Yu et. al. in their 2020 paper entitled \"Predicting Temporal Sets with Deep Neural Networks\"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394486.3403152).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the data, we will be using the first couple of months from the [Dunhumby's \"The Complete Journey\" dataset](https://medium.com/r?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dunnhumby.com%2Fsource-files%2F). It contains transaction level data for over 2500 households in a general goods store."

    "### Problem formalization\n",
    "We are given a sequence of sets *{$s^{1}_{i}$, $s^{2}_{i}$, ... $s^{T_{max}}_{i}$}.* Each set in this sequence describes the items that were purchased by household *i* on their *t-th* visit to the general goods store, where $t \\in \\{ 1 \\dots T_{max} \\}$-th . For example, if $s^{1}_{42} = \\{\\text{item}_{26}, \\text{item}_{07}, \\text{item}_{33}\\},$ this means that the household with the identifier *42* bought three items on their first visit to this supermarket. Namely, they bought the items with identifiers 26, 07 and 33.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to train a deep neural network that will be able to take into account both the similarities between individual items, as well as the temporal purchasing habits of individual households. With such a model, we want to predict the probable contents of a subsequent shopping basket by household *i*. More formally, we want to train the function *f* in:\n",
    "$$ s^{T_{max}+1} = f\\big{(} s^{1}_{i}, s^{2}_{i}, \\dots s^{T_{max}}_{i} | \\Theta_{f}  \\big{)}, $$ where $\\Theta_{f}$ is the set of all trainable parameters of our model."

As we'll soon see, we'll construct the representations of our sets using networks: a data structure composed of vertices and edges. To parse them efficiently, we will use the well established network library, [networkx](https://networkx.org/). We'll also extract some data from the [originalsource transaction csv file]() <font color=\"red\"> <---link needed here </font>. We'll use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) only to process that.\n",

    "# Part 1: Constructing weighted graphs.\n",
    "As seen in the accompanying blog post, our method proposes a weighted graph convolutional network on dynamic graphs, which represent individual shopping carts. Very briefly, we need to first construct the sets from the transaction level source `.csv` file. Then, we extract the (normalized) frequency of co-occuring item pairs. Finally, we transform each shopping set to a weighted graph, where items that co-occur in it are connected with edges, weighted by the mentioned co-occurrence frequency. To each such graph, we also add self-loops of singletons that don't appear in this particular shopping cart, but are purchased by the household in some other shopping cart $s_{i}^{t}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of our approach is thus to construct these graphs. As this is quite computationally expensive, we offload the creation of these graphs into a different colab, which [you can access by clicking here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1vyahNq6Jo60Bg4tcMv0mfqs9Lwz5uXpC?usp=sharing).\n",

It's keys denote the codes of all housholds in the `Graphs` folder, while it's values will be lists of `torch.data.Data` objects, representing shopping baskets from the household's discrete trips to the general goods store. Hence, at `shopping_per_hh[\"1000\"][4]`, we will find the `torch.data.Data` graph, describing household's `hid=\"1000\"` fourth tip to the store and the items they purchased.\n",
    "\n",

    "* into `data.x`, we will save a tensor of size $(N, 1)$, where *N* is the number of nodes appearing in this graph. This tensor will denote node features, needed for our eventual GCN model to run. Because we want to treat all nodes equally, we give them equivalent features (ones).\n",

The tensor will be a multi-hot encoding and will hold ones in the indices, corresponding to the indices of the items contained in this graph's shopping basket in our static matrix representations of all items $E$. (to learn more about this, reference the Medium blog). We construct these tensors using the `reverse_uid` dictionary, that we initialized before. This dictionary will ( upon the initialization of `E` later ) serve as a reference map between the row indices of $E$ and the dataset item codes."
